# AgendaSync
AgendaSync is a minimalistic agenda made for healthcare professionnals to help them optimize and manage their time, by coordinating all scheduling-related tasks in a single application. This application is also meant to be cross-platform by establishing a link through real time synchronization to other existing web solutions. 
The mobile agenda was developed using the framework Flutter, as well the real-time synchronization was tested using postman then realized through dart code using the websites' APIs.
